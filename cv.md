# About myself

I am 24 years old. My current job is full of ordinary and uninteresting routine. However, among my colleagues, I have established myself as a responsible, reliable and executive person. I have always wanted to try my hand at web development, because I am attracted by the tasks that this activity poses for itself. I know I still have a lot to learn, but I believe that with the right approach, I will eventually achieve my goal. The main thing is to never stop working and always be ready to learn something new !

# Сode example
 
Write a function toWeirdCase (weirdcase in Ruby) that accepts a string, and returns the same string with all even indexed characters in each word upper cased, and all odd indexed characters in each word lower cased. The indexing just explained is zero based, so the zero-ith index is even, therefore that character should be upper cased and you need to start over for each word.

```
function toWeirdCase(string){
  return string.split(' ').map(function(word){
    return word.split('').map(function(letter, i){
  if( i % 2 == 0) {
    return letter.toUpperCase()
    } else {
      return letter.toLowerCase()
    }    
    }).join('');
  }).join(' ');
}
```
